## ‚öôÔ∏è Local Installation

### Prerequisites

-   **Docker** (latest version recommended) ‚Äî [Download Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   **Docker Compose** (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

-   Using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/hussainkazarani/pathless-trails.git
    cd pathless-trails
    ```

-   Or download the ZIP and extract it.

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

-   The repository already includes a `.env` file with dummy values.
-   Open the `.env` file at the root and update the database and server credentials as needed:

    ```env
    # App
    PORT=1000

    # Database
    POSTGRES_USER=hussainkazarani
    POSTGRES_PASSWORD=kazarani
    POSTGRES_DB=pathless_trails
    POSTGRES_HOST=custom-postgres
    POSTGRES_PORT=5432
    ```

> **Note:** `POSTGRES_HOST` should remain "custom-postgres" ‚Äî this is the service name defined in `docker-compose.yml` and ensures Node.js connects to the PostgreSQL container. Do **NOT** use "localhost" inside Docker.

## Running the Application

### Starting Locally

-   Navigate to the `deploy` folder:

    ```bash
    cd deploy
    ```

-   Run Docker Compose using the included `.env` file:

    ```bash
    docker compose --env-file ../.env up
    ```

-   This will start both the **Node.js server** and **PostgreSQL database** locally.

### Stopping the Application

-   To stop the running containers:

    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

### Accessing the Game

-   Open your browser and go to:

    ```
    http://localhost:1000
    ```

-   Replace `1000` with the port specified in your `.env` file if it was changed.
